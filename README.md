| Summary Title | Target |Technical Severity|Vulnerability Details | Description & Solution |
|----------|------------|-|----------------|---|
| [External Redirect](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/601.html "Mitre External Redirect")  |   http://rest.vulnweb.com/| High  |  A web application accepts a user-controlled input that specifies a link to an external site, and uses that link in a Redirect. This simplifies phishing attacks. | An http parameter may contain a URL value and could cause the web application to redirect the request to the specified URL. By modifying the URL value to a malicious site, an attacker may successfully launch a phishing scam and steal user credentials. Because the server name in the modified link is identical to the original site, phishing attempts have a more trustworthy appearance.  **Solution:** Use an intermediate disclaimer page that provides the user with a clear warning that they are leaving the current site. Implement a long timeout before the redirect occurs, or force the user to click on the link. Be careful to avoid XSS problems when generating the disclaimer page.  |
| Cross Site Scripting Reflected  |  http://testphp.vulnweb.com/   |   High  | Cross-site Scripting XSS is an attack technique that involves echoing attacker-supplied code into a user s browser instance.   | Cross-site Scripting attacks essentially compromise the trust relationship between a user and the web site. Applications utilizing browser object instances which load content from the file system may execute code under the local machine zone allowing for system compromise. There are three types of Cross-site Scripting attacks: non-persistent, persistent and DOM-based. Non-persistent attacks and DOM-based attacks require a user to either visit a specially crafted link laced with malicious code, or visit a malicious web page containing a web form, which when posted to the vulnerable site, will mount the attack. Using a malicious form will oftentimes take place when the vulnerable resource only accepts HTTP POST requests. In such a case, the form can be submitted automatically, without the victim s knowledge e.g. by using JavaScript . Upon clicking on the malicious link or submitting the malicious form, the XSS payload will get echoed back and will get interpreted by the user s browser and execute.   **Solution:** Use LIMIT and other SQL controls within queries to prevent mass disclosure of records in case of SQL injection.  |
